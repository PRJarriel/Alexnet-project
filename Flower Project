#Flower Project
##By: Peyton R. Jarriel

##The Idea:
The idea with this project is to be able create a alexnet model that can determine the type of flower
just based on the color and any surrding leaves or parts. To prepare for this I took 5 pictures of 5
random flowers around my campus for my test variables and then researched the type of flower there were
and then took a picture off of google to use for my valid variable. 

##The Process:
AlexNet consists of eight layers, including five convolutional layers and three 
fully connected layers. The convolutional layers are used to extract features from
the input image, and the fully connected layers are used for classification.
One of the key innovations of AlexNet is the use of Rectified Linear Units (ReLU)
as activation functions, which helped to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and
speed up training. Another important contribution was the use of data augmentation
techniques, such as random cropping and flipping, which helped to reduce overfitting
and improve generalization.

slides:
The only slides I have are the one I put together of the 25 pictures I took so I 
figure I will include them.

#Notebook:
This is the google colab notebook that was used to create and train my model so it can predict the 
type of flower correctly.
