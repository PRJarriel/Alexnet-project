#ALexNet Brain Project
##By: Peyton R. Jarriel


##The Idea
In theory I should be able to make use a alexnet model that can determine 
two diffrent type of tumors in the brain. We are comparing between 
glioma and meningioma tumors. Some of the diffrences I wish for the alexnet
to be able to identify is the diffence in size, shape, and potential location
of the tumor.

##The Process
AlexNet consists of eight layers, including five convolutional layers and three 
fully connected layers. The convolutional layers are used to extract features from
the input image, and the fully connected layers are used for classification.
One of the key innovations of AlexNet is the use of Rectified Linear Units (ReLU)
as activation functions, which helped to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and
speed up training. Another important contribution was the use of data augmentation
techniques, such as random cropping and flipping, which helped to reduce overfitting
and improve generalization.

##My presentation:
The following presentation is one that I completed in class, In the presentation I go into my goal
in the project as stated before. I also go into detail about the convolution, pooling, and relu process. 
and finally I end my presentation with recapping the results of my project by showing a screenshot of the
valid and test acc.

##The code and notebook:
The following is my google colab notebook which has all the code I used for the project as well as 
some comments throughout the notebook to help detail what is happening within all the code. 

##Loom Video
The following is a Loom video detailing and explaining the process of gathering and setting up the
data as well as testing it out to make sure it works. I apologize for the video not being a youtube
video but it was giving me trouble, I also apologize for the videos being seperate, I just wanted to
make sure I had atleast the first one recorded so I didn't forget before I submitted.
